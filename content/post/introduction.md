Hello. I'm Brandon and I would like to welcome you to my blog. I am a first generation german-american (on my mother's side) with passionate interests in computers and personal growth. I come from a split family, with my parents divoced, but with time I have come to apprichate that aspect of my life. After all, without it I would not know so many wonderful people I do today. For example... I never would have found my now Husband

**Where did Brandon Bleau come from to get here?**

Brandon was born the United States to his US army father and German immigrant mother. Raised in a split family after their divoce, he recalls times before the devoice and after. He would not change how things turned out, because without the divoce he would not have meet his Step Father or Step Siblings, and most of all he would not have gotten to hold his little Brother Al when he was still a baby.

**Who is Brandon Bleau as he stands before us today?**

As confirmed by Aaron, Brandon is a high functioning asshole. USDA Grade A certified ass hole.

**Where does Brandon see himself in 5, 10, 20 years?**

Brandon hopes to have a greater understanding of the German language. He hopes to be speaking it more at home and with his family. Becides his language learning he hopes to still contain the same spart he does today for software development. 

**How does Brandon plan on getting to acomplish his dreams?**
